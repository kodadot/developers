## What's KodaDot?


KodaDot has started as rework of dotapp dashboard which was supposed to be bulk version of components to interact with Substrate networks, namely first two relaychains, Polkadot and Kusama. Through many iterations, KodaDot was born as first NFT explorer of Kusama NFTs in early 2021, nowadays standard known as RMRK. Later KodaDot took radical step to involve external contributors, which contributed over 20+ language translations of KodaDot. 

Continuing there as experiment, founders decided to reward people with $KSM for their contributions and set up bounty system, nowadays known as K-Bounties. This helped KodaDot to grow stable inflow of developers who wanted to engage in Polkadot ecosystem and gain significant frontend experience with Substrate and get paid. 

After successfull initial funding, KodaDot has keep attracting usage through mass mint, mass-drop and seamless interactions for users.

## Apreaciation of KodaDot open-source contribution

## KodaDot design -- K-brutalism

Brutalism and neobrutalism are two design movements coming from offline world, yet noticed significant alternative audience leaning to this design which can be prevalent in the future. It's inspired by 90s, simple MS-DOS interfaces to keep minimal shapes, less noise and clear design. With focus on functionality and information availability, we believe KodaDot simply stand out among other NFT marketplaces through custom componetns.
