# Frequently Asked Questions

## **What are NFTs?**

NFT or non-fungible tokens refer to unique assets, which are stored on blockchain and maintain unique ownership.

### **What is Minting?**

Minting is a process in which your cryptocurrency wallet and blockchain communicate together and make you able to create nfts.

## KodaDot

### **Are you funded?**

 Right now, we have the [Kusama Treasury funding for Milestone 1](https://kodadot.xyz/rmrk/@.common:links.kusama_polkassembly.href). We are actively looking for funding options and will eventually raise private funds. Please feel free to reach out to us via Discord if you are interested in private sale.

### **How can I mint NFTs through KodaDot?**

In the left upper corner, you click on [create](https://kodadot.xyz/rmrk/create) and choose simple or classic mint. If you don't know how to continue, you can [move](tutorials/how-to-mint.md) to this tutorial.

### **I've mined an NFT, but it's not showing up**

The best way to check if your mint has been successful is through [Subscan Explorer](https://kusama.subscan.io/). [Here is what a successfully minted NFT would look like](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/6095478-1)

### **What's the difference between creating Classic, Simple and Permafrost?**

- CLASSIC mint let you create a collection and add NFTs to it
- SIMPLE mint will create NFT collectible and add it to your profile 
- PERMAFROST is nft minting using the **Arweave** protocol: The protocol matches people who have hard drive space to spare with those individuals and organizations that need to store data or host content permanently.

### **Is it possible to move NFTs from one collection to another?**
Not at the moment. 

### **Royalties streams settings?**

 - Right now, we don't have chain logic, but we plan to implement something great, soon. 

 ### What are NFT royalties?
 Royalties, or royalty payments, are financial payments that are made from one party to another for the ongoing use of their assets. The term is most commonly associated with the music industry, where musicians allow their records to be played on the radio, streamed online, or sampled by other musicians in exchange for a (royalty) fee. However, it isnâ€™t just musicians that are owed royalties when their work is used. Songwriters, composers, publishers, novelists, producers, and just about anybody involved in a creative process has the potential to claim royalties. 

 NFT royalties give artists a percentage of the sale price each time their artwork is resold. No matter how many secondary sales occur, the royalties will always be paid back to the original creator, and the best part is that the whole process is automated. 

### **What does SEND, CONSUME, and LIST mean?**

 - SEND will send it to someone
 - CONSUME will burn it
 - LIST will list it for sale so someone can buy it from you

### **Is there an official KodaDot token?**
No, there is no official token launched. Please follow official social media and be aware of scams and phishing attempts from unofficial sources. DYOR.

### **Minting Guidelines**
All minted files will observe the Code of Conduct and all NSFW (Not Safe For Work) files should be classified NSFW when minting.


### Can I purchase NFTs from my phone?

Yes! Currently the KodaDot's integration with the [Nova wallet](https://novawallet.io/) is in production. We've made a [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuPAcG4gKzA&t=4s) and written [an article](https://docs.kodadot.xyz/tutorials/how-to-kodadot-phone-ios.html#how-to-mint-nfts-from-ios-device) on how to do this.

**How can I open the developer console?**
 If you are on Chrome hit **Option, CMD, J**, Firefox **Command + Option + K**.

### Can someone purchase my art more than once?
RMRK is currently just an NFT baked into the blockchain and doesn't have any chain logic. 

We're aware of the possibility that two or more people can make transactions in the same block, which can cause them to lose money. At that point, we rely on the artist to refund the money or mint the same NFT as a token of appreciation. 

## Kusama/KSM


**Kusama** is a pre-production environment for the Polkadot network. "They share the same underlying architecture: a multichain, heterogeneously-sharded design based on "Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)" Consensus.
**$KSM** is the coin used for interacting the Kusama network.



### **Why did you choose to build on Kusama/Polkadot and not Ethereum?**
We believe that costs for actions on the Ethereum mainnet will continue to increase along with its environmentally damaging PoW. A more detailed answer can be found [here](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/issues/529)

### **How can I sell/buy KSM?**
You can sell or buy KSM (with any currency depending on the exchange) through [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), using our RAMP network [integration](https://kodadot.xyz/rmrk/credit) and [Bybit](https://www.bybit.com/en-US/). 


### **How do I set my Identity?**
 - You can learn more [how to set identity on Kusama network](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/learn-identity).

### **What is Existential Deposit (ED)?**

On the Polkadot network, an address is only active when it holds a minimum amount, currently set at 1 DOT (and 0.0000333333 KSM on the Kusama network). This minimum amount is called the Existential Deposit (ED).

The ED exists so that accounts with very small balances, or completely empty, do not "bloat" the state of the blockchain in order to maintain high performance and to reduce fees. 
The existential deposit as of this writing is 0.0000333333 $KSM but be sure to keep at least 0.1 $KSM in your wallet avoid consequences.



### What are the transfer fees on Kusama?
The cost of transferring KSM is [dynamic](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/faq/#what-are-the-transfer-fees-for-kusama). Currently, the minimum cost of transferring KSM is 0.01 KSM (the base fee). Although, this can be changed via governance. 


## Milestone 2 

### **Can I use this in AR/VR?**

 We are exploring possibilities, we actually plan to actively research on this in our milestone 2.
