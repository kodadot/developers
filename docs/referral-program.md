# ****Koda****Dot Artist Referral Program 🎨

Get rewarded for referring artists to [KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz/). We are committed to supporting the growth and success of artists in the NFT space, and our referral program is a key part of that commitment.  You will be helping to build a thriving community of creators, collectors, and enthusiasts. Our referral program is a great way to get involved.

## Referral Program

The reward is **100 USD** in KSM for bringing a new artist to KodaDot! (**50 USD** for **you** and **50 USD** for the **artist**). Here you can find everything you need to know about this program. 

### Process

1. Find an artist that meets the conditions
2. The artist will mint his/her collection on KodaDot
3. The artist will fill out [the form](https://form.kodadot.xyz/referral), and you will both get rewarded
