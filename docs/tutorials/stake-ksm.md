#### Congratulations! You've gotten a bounty from a successful PR you submitted- but now what?

If you're converting it to fiat (aww inflation sucks!) or keeping it just in your wallet, maybe you'll want to learn how to make your $KSM work for you without you doing anything! 

## Let's learn about how to stake your $KSM!
This tutorial is intended for nominators (i.e those who are staking to the validators and earning rewards passively).

It's recommended that you [generate](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/learn-account-generation/) a separate Controller (the account that will start/stop staking) AND Stash (the account that will hold large funds) key.

1. Navigate to the Staking option in the Network dropdown menu
(/stake-ksm)







"When looking for validators to nominate, a nominator should pay attention to their own reward percentage for nominating a specific validator - as well as the risk that they bear of being slashed if the validator gets slashed."

###### please make sure you understand the risks of staking [here](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/learn-staking#slashing)!
