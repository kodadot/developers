# Beginner-friendly intro to digital assets, blockchain and NFTs

## Is this page for you?

- This is ideal place for someone who is getting in touch with web3/digital assets technologies and wants to learn everything at one place.
- This is work in progress and there'll be many links leading to more thorough concepts.

- If you're just getting started in the world of digital assets, then the amount of information may seem a bit overwhelming at first.

- Blockchains, forks, stablecoins, mining, staking, exchanges, security, hardware wallets.. Yup, it seems like there's no ending.

- No worries, nobody says you have to learn everything in one day, in fact, once you understand basic concepts it's very easy.
Digital assets are revolutionary technology, and they bring a whole set of unique concepts with them.

- If you're are just getting started with cryptos, then get ready to forget or recycle many concepts from the legacy financial system.

## What are digital assets?

Let's start from the beginning. What are digital assets? How is it different from a credit card or other instruments from the legacy financial system?

A digital asset is a technology which allows value to be transferred from peer to peer, anywhere in the world, without requiring trust between the parties involved.

Sounds simple, right?

It's a novel technology that allows anyone to become their own bank. When you need to send money to someone else, simply request their address, paste it into a wallet and hit send. That's all there is to it.

Digital assets work from person to person, without a credit card processor, bank or any other middleman involved.

Which brings us to the next subject:

## Value: Decentralizaton

When it comes to digital assets, there is one magic word you'll hear a lot: decentralization.

In fact, decentralization is the single biggest difference between digital assets and the old financial system. Digital assets make feasible a world where the financial system is governed by individuals, not by centralized institutions.

When you type your password into a credit card machine, you're actually not sending funds directly to the salesman. There's at least one bank between you and them (in most cases there may be several banks involved).

You and the salesman both trust the banking institution sitting between you.

You trust that only the amount you authorized will be debited from your account. The salesperson trusts they'll receive the right amount when the credit card balance gets settled.

There's a lot of trust involved here!

The architecture where you trust a middleman to complete a financial transaction is called a centralized architecture. There is a central person or institution that actually carries out the financial transaction on your behalf.

Digital assets, on the other hand, are decentralized.

They do not involve any trust at all. Cryptocurrency systems work because of a solid mathematical foundation, not because you trust the middleman to do the right thing. In one word, digital assets are trustless.

## How is this all possible? Blockchain

### Blockchain definiton:

Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). 
Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.

### Why is this important?

Why blockchain is important: Business runs on information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.

The blockchain is just a record of every valid transaction that has ever taken place, and it is the ultimate authority when determining everyone’s balance. 

## Key elements of a blockchain 

### Distributed ledger technology 

All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions. With this shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that’s typical of traditional business networks.

### Immutable records

No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it’s been recorded to the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible.

### Smart contracts

To speed transactions, a set of rules — called a smart contract — is stored on the blockchain and executed automatically. A smart contract can define conditions for corporate bond transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more.

## Exchanges

When the number of digitalassets exploded, so did all the different ways to exchange one for another.

Cryptocurrency exchanges, which are systems where you could send some digital assets and receive tens of different assets on the other end, sprung up everywhere.

Exchanges are like stock brokers that allow you to securely trade cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies and also for fiat money (dollars, euros and so on).

It's important to note, that you only trully own your digital assets(cryptocurrencies) when you store them on a non-custodial hardware or software wallet

## What are custodial and non-custodial wallets?
### Custodial Wallet?

A custodial wallet means that a third party is holding your private keys for you. This will usually be the exchange or platform where you purchased your currency. This type of wallet requires you to trust this third party with your private keys, keeping your funds secure for you and giving them to you when you need them.

### Non-Custodial Wallet?

In contrast, a non-custodial wallet gives you complete control over your private keys. That means you’re totally in control of your funds. The third party is removed from the equation, but it also means you have sole responsibility for keeping track of your keys.

## Keys.. keys everywhere

When you first buy some digital asset, you are issued two keys: a public key, which works like an email address (meaning you can safely share it with others, allowing you to send or receive funds), and a private key, which is typically a string of letters and numbers (and which is not to be shared with anyone). 

You can think of the private key as a password that unlocks the virtual vault that holds your money. As long as you — and only you — have access to your private key, your funds are safe and can be managed anywhere in the world with an internet connection. 
Where should you store your private keys?

## Where can i store my private keys(seed phrase)?

### First option - custodial solution

You can store them online in a crypto wallet: The best and simplest option for most people is to use a virtual wallet, like the one offered by exchanges(custodial wallet), to manage your private keys. These are known as “hot” wallets, because your private keys are stored on the internet. This makes buying, selling, or using your digital money as convenient and accessible as using a credit card online. Choose a wallet provided by a company with a long track record for security and features like two-factor authentication. 

### Second option - non-custodial solution

Store them offline somewhere safe: Some people choose to keep their private keys on a computer that isn’t connected to the internet, written on pieces of paper, or even just memorized. This is referred to as “cold storage,” and while it does protect your private key against digital theft, it makes using your cryptocurrency much less convenient while creating other risks.

### Custodial Wallets - Pros and Cons

Both custodial and non-custodial wallets have their pros and cons. Custodial wallets are a great option if you’re looking for convenience. They’re accessible and easy to use, and there’s less responsibility when using one. You’ll be able to log into the account for the platform or exchange that holds your wallet whenever you want to access your funds. If you happen to lose the password, you can probably reset it to recover access to your account. You won’t lose your keys and you can even save on fees.

On the other hand, there are also downsides to using a custodial wallet. Storing your coins in a custodial wallet firstly means that you don’t exactly own them. Similar to storing your money with a bank, the exchange owes you the coins when you want to withdraw them. Custodial wallets may also be less secure. A data breach or hack can put everyone’s funds at risk. Determining how likely this is to occur requires scrutinization of the exchange’s security measures.


### Non-Custodial Wallets - Pros and Cons

Non-custodial wallets offer the benefit of giving you control over your funds. You’re responsible for your private keys when you use non-custodial wallets, which gives you control and security. You’re the one who has to approve transactions and you can make quick withdrawals because you’re not waiting for anyone else to approve anything. Using a non-custodial wallet can lower your risk of security issues too. You have a small amount of funds compared to big exchanges, making you less of a target. You might also be able to access your funds without an internet connection.

However, being responsible for your wallet means you have to keep your private keys safe. If you lose your key, you could also lose the funds that it will give you access to. You’re on your own, and you won’t have anyone to help you.

Custodial and non-custodial crypto wallets each have pros and cons. Consider these carefully before choosing one.
