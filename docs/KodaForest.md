# GretaForest

As NFTs grow in size and popularity, there have been increasing concerns about the effects it may have on the enviornment. There are countless articles hightlighting the energy consumption and emissions caused by NFT transactions, ultimately influencing and supporting the increasing stigma around NFTs as a whole. However, we're here to be one of the marketplaces to start a reforestation initiative. 

We'd like to start off developing a collection called NFTrees that put emphasis on challenges that our world's forests are facing. Our purpose is to unite eco-designers around the world combat pollution in the forest. 

A percentage of each NFTree will go to the artists envolved AND donated directly to [Fridays for Future](https://fridaysforfuture.org/europebeyondburning/).


## Upcoming Events
### KodaForest Fest 

#### Happening in May/June 2023, KodaFest is a three day festival focusing on sustainability in technology in Centre Portugal. 

The purpose of the KodaForest Fest is to build connections and long lasting relationships between associations/non-profits around the world as well as highlight the efforts of tech organizations like KodaDot and RMTerra's.
