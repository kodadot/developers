# Reactive NFTs 

## What's Reactive NFTs all about?
We had need with our [Kodadot developers contributors](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery) to craft special actions for game creators, be interoperable between other protocols & parachains plus on to be Metaverse-ready for other integrations to full fill our [Middleware thesis](https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/1022143345353781254). 

We've dreamed of things where, **we as creators** can collaborate on crafts together, matter if it's game items or series of their emotional production, they should have ability to share and influence their featurings. If it's just simple items for identity, access lists for your community or smart (with custom designed utility) items in your game,  part of your complex game mechanics or bootstraping your gaming community around cause or particular alignment.

## Detailed features of Reactive NFTs
### Auctions 
- With Auctions you can enable fair launches of your NFT collections for your community, which has potential to help distribution through various mechanism. One of most known mechanics for Auctions are Dutch auctions, English and Candle Auctions

### Royalties
- We will introduce first trustless and native NFT royalties within Dotsama ecosystem in tight cooperation with Basilisk parachain. You could set which and what amount you can recieve from second order sales. Hence it's trustless, you don't need to rely on frontend and anyone using other frontned will make sure royalty is fairly processed. What's does this means? If you sale your NFT, you can rely on trustless execution of transaction and not rely on single API endpoint or if someone made wrong implementation on their indexer (That's still case of early stage Dotsama NFTs)
- Trustless Proxied Royalties would help you to set cause where you want to stream % of revenue, could for example for reforestation of KodaForest, charity usecase or simply drive portion of your royalties to friend who've you've been collabing togehter. 

### Make Offers
- With trustless implementation of Make Offers mostly known from OpenSea it's coined as standard 

### Collab
- Lot's of DAOs thrive for creative usecase of NFTs. Where we've realized this imminent need on markets, we will enable you collab together with your sizeable amount of friends on collections. Example you can have shared collection where people can add their mints, manage them together and have simple permissions for access lists, for example based on soulbond tokens

### Revenue Share
- With native social infrastructure like DAOs are for web3, we would need to have things naturally revenue sharing among participants. Clear demonstration of this case is when creators A,B,C creates single NFT together and they can recieve upfront % from sales and royalties they agreed on

### Reactive Actions
- TBD

### Fractions
- We've studied lot of ways how you can fractalize single NFT into many piecies. With this mechanism comes engagement within your community and strengten your tribe around use case. Imagine you want to make your single NFT liquid for various reasons and to enable it has financial properties, where Liquid NFT could be use as collateral in loans. With Soulbond tokens it's quite powerful 

### Equips
- This is abstraction of our one core NFT primitive like (bi-)linking and with this powerful feature you can for example equip your spells with various forces in your RPG games. Anticipated plan is that this links could be autonomous in form or reactive actions

### Scheduler
- With every game requires to schedule when you open new levels, when users can buy particular item or timing quests which could be pegged to blocktime or real world clocks. It's vital part of every game and especially procedurally generated games

### Loot and Bundles
- With naturally (bi)linking comes way to put more NFTs into one basket and people can bundle them as one jumbo NFTs which would help create interesting trading mechanics in various RPG games, where for example it could be natural part for mystery boxes and adding surprise factor for 

### Unlockables 
- With unlockables properties, NFT items would naturally lurk people to thrive for various mints with variable reward mechanism, based on revealing content of particular mints. This primtiive would help us to build zkNFTs, various lottery tickets games, new native use cases for RPG games

### Forking / Remixing 
- Forking is naturally mimicking how human's brain work within taking inspiration of art. Rather than mitigating copymints, we would embrace culture where someone can fork your art with preserving license requirements and you can accrue royalties to your original art work. This part is heavily inspired how works in GIT and Github. Like KodaDot has 190+ forks and anyone can benefit from our codebase or choose to contribute to upstream. 
- Remixing is way where we will take Forking step further and add ability to mashup someone's else art if that would be allowed. What that means? If you would like for example create master piece creation using someone's picture and glue it with music. Same goes for 3d models, audio or generative art

### Protocol Native Licensing
- Eternal part of NFTs are way to keep license in tact we would embrace having licensing properties stick with art. Are you fan of cc0, unlicense or some opininated license like [cc by-nc-sa 4.0 or cc by-nc-nd](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/) 

### BackLinks - Referencing and Bi-linking on-chain
- This is one of our core NFT primitives which tells you on-chain, which NFT is pointing to your NFT or where NFT is pointing to. If there will be mutual reference, we call it bi-linking. This will adds more awareness which NFT item is referencing to your NFT item. In traditional HTTP world you are following hyperlinks to particular page and with backlinks you can see which websites are poining to particular website. This could open doors to gain access to highly related NFTs without need to curating collection or NFTs to some list. 
- Backlinks can help you discover interesting relationhips between NFTs and it will faciliate another degree of creating open graphs between and within NFT game items which could be further used in other applications build around it as supplemental applications 

### Verification through token holding
- With social tokens, we fully realized power of social fandoms, that what's need to prove community requires to have holding of your token project and community participants  can then proof skin-in-the-game of among particular participants. This part is still in active research, where we are considering for example setting particular vesting period, i.e. how long token needs to be present on particular address or what sizeable amount needs to be hold during time, i.e. you will avoid people who are short-term believers in your community building ethos.


### Advanced Nested Traits System (GameFi ready)
- With exponential boom of various spatial worlds, metaverse parcels, VRM avatars, Advanced Gaming items we identified need to have way to set various traits for particular NFT items. Usual NFT items supports 1-level of traits, where rarity could be limited to combination of first level these traits. Other way around we are thinking, where we can add nested traits for gaming assets and it would enable other MMORPG and procedurally generated game items longevity of assets through special nested rarity. 


## Creative usecases
- Generative art 
- Personalization
- New way of adding utility for NFTs
- Conditional NFTs
  - Looking forward to hyper-personalize your NFTs for whatever you would like to?
  - Art will adjust based on 
    - how much emotes recieved
    - which logged address is looking at art
    - who owns art
    - who sold the art
    - what amount of users owning collection
    - any other on-chain metric we can use as parameter
- No-code/low-code framework
  - Within KodaDot, we enable users to mint their artwork to abstract complexity, starting with generative art and then beyond. 
- Mint your NFT with sub-level details, means it's ready for VRM-based avatars and any other Metaverse standards
  - See Advanced Trait Systems
- Whenever you are minting with your friends and want to set revenue share within group sales
  - See Revenue share 
- When you make collection out of single NFT, you can naturually create DAO holders within your community
  - See Collab
- Thanks to linking NFTs you can equip your NFTs with other super powers, where other NFTs are indepedent from state of others
  - See Backlinks
- With Reactive actions you can model your game scenario in like when someone passes one-level, it can automatically recieve soulbond token as achievement
- Want to set timer in your game level? With our scheduler you can adjust whenever procedural levels will be available for players to play.
  - See Scheduler
- You care about licensing, thus with every remix or fork, NFTs will inherit licensing
  - See Protocol Native Licensing
- Making mystery boxes, loots and bundles of other game items is eternal property of game items, where you can introduce randomness factor into your game
  - See Loot and Bundles
- Don't want to uncover special levels even they would be on-chain? With unlockables would not be issue.
  - See Unlockables



## Release plan
### Basilisk
- With Basilisk deployment we will open flood gates for new range of creators around liqud NFTs.
- Trustless Royalties 
  - This will open doors artists to collect royalty whenever their art will be sold on secondary markets, keeping royalties is vital part of NFTs where it helps drive steady income for artists and open doors to live off their crafts in sustainable way
- Trustless Proxied Royalties 
  - You can redirect portion of your proceeds to some cause. In example, in KodaDot you can drive portion to KodaForest to contribute reforestation in Portugal. 
- Make Offers 
  - Whenever you will mint your art, you can trustlessly recieve offers for your art. This will open new avenue of DeFi apps on top of this offers orderbook.
- Auctions
  - We plan to have Dutch, English and Candle auctions. This would help other people leveraging auctions in their games

## Astar
- WASM support 
  - With Kodadot we would enable developers to fast prototyping stuff right away to deploy their NFT Dapp on Astar.
  - Plan to support basic NFT marketplace with minting and let others expand stuff there
  - Open doors to permisionless smart-contracts within KodaDot for anyone to play with

## Your parachain
- We always looking forward to put your NFT standard into pipeline and happy to thrill with your parachain community. 
- If your parachain is interested to have KodaDot, [feel free to reach to our team member yangwao](https://twitter.com/yangwao).




We've felt that protocol in Dotsama are quite opinionated so we come with our own, less-to-no opinionated NFT protocol

how RNFTs will work
conditional, hook enabled, token as entity
why conditional NFTs
how it will work
how it will be implemented?
demonstrate the use case, how people can use it in their app
promote subsalt?
