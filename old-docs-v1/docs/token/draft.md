### Tokenomics KodaDot Token $kodao

These are briefly notes of our tokenomics based on our first community call. 
It's prior change and just give out ideation.
We would have probably these phases of slow fashion distribution

### Phases 
- seed family 
  - people who are frequently hanging with us on Discord
  - minted on KodaDot and bought NFTs through KodaDot in past 
- sidehustle
  - people naturally will accumulate $kodao token for actions made on KodaDot, like mint and buy in small increments   
- listings
  - we plan to allocate some portion amount to be acquired elsewhere
  - karura/bifrost

### Why you want to hold $kodao token?

#### As Artist
- You will have chance to be highlighted on KodaDot and filtered out from others. To be short, your crafts will stand out. We will tell this on your profile for users visiting your profile on KodaDot. There will be various levels of holdings to better recognize your depth of skin-in-the-game

#### As Collector
- Same as above plus you will be eglible to vote as curation board member which art will be highlighted on frontpage on weekly basis

#### As a Steward
- Reporting Copy Minter. Goal is to filter out fraudsters out of our collections

#### As a Developer
- We will be significantly lowering payouts in $KSM and pushing more rewarding in $koDAO tokens
### Utility

- Main utility would be reputation as we would like to prevent copy minters and raise barrier and in this manner filter them out.
- Recognition among community holders. Those who naturally accumulated token will be seen in our TBD passion feed.
- Driving valuation $kodao through reputation. Intrinsic value driven with extrinsic valuation.

### Recognition levels
