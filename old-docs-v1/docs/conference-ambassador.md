# **Conference remote presesence ambassador**

Thank you for helping us by bringing [KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz/) to another conference. You will be attending events as a team member. We aim to introduce our project to a new audience and help them understand it more.

## KodaDot

We are a **multi-chain NFT marketplace** in the fast-growing Kusama (Polkadot) ecosystem with very **low minting and transaction fees**. Currently, we are supporting 5 NFT standardsÂ  (RMRKv1, RMRKv2, MoonBeam, MoonRiver, Basilisk), and another upcoming 3 are work-in-progress (Astar, Gear/Vara, Statemine). Our rich developer community got us among the top 3 Polkadot projects, and we are [the top 1 dapp](https://github.com/topics/polkadot) by GitHub metrics in the Polkadot ecosystem.
