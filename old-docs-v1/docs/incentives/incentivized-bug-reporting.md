# Incentivised Bug Reporting

We are building KodaDot for everyone. As we are creators and builders, **we are users of KodaDot**. Sometimes it's pretty normal that we encounter erroneous behaviour or something doesn't work for us. **Quality of KodaDot is based on development iterations and strong feedback loop by users themselves.**

Thus if you do encounter an error next time, we would really love you to report back to us and we can surely **reward you for this behaviour.** For us it's really valuable feedback, because till we have client side reporting tool, **you might improve comfort of using KodaDot for you in the future and help others.** There is high probability, same error could be encountered by someone else. **Yet till, if we are not aware of some bug, we can't fix it.**

**The sooner you report it to us, the sooner we can push the fix to the production. Easy as that.**

### Rewards

We would like to reward you for this behaviour, mainly for every reported bug which is **reproducible and mitigated.** 
Mitigating means that the reported bug is fixed and merged into `main` branch and you are incentivized to supervise pull-request during time to fix this issue. 

- Current rewards, **depends on complexity of bug.**
- Basic bug reports scales starting **from $50 up to $300.**
- For security bugs range is from **$300 up to $5000.**
