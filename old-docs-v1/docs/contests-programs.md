# Active Contests
Our contests don't have a strict deadline. We allow entries on an ongoing basis and send rewards out where we see fit. Once we see the attention around a contest becoming dull, we'll stop and move onto another contest. Although entries are welcomed on an ongoing basis, you must adhere to the terms and conditions of said contest.
