## Working for KodaDot
We are remote-friendly and asyncronous! Timezones aren't a problem here, we have contributors from around the world. As long as you're making progress at your own pace and staying on schedule with other team members, there's not a difference. However, some of the most common characteristics we've seen from current members of KodaDot is their organization, time management skills, and communication. 

Here at KodaDot, you're not expected to be a know-it-all. You're expected to learn and grow from the tasks you take on and the interactions you make with our community. KodaDot was created with the public in mind, hence us being a "public good". We want to make sure that inclusivity is enforced for people with all levels of experience. However, we want to make sure that you're taking tasks that you're motivated to complete, not just to have them assigned to you with no progress. Don't be afraid to ask questions. We're encouraging growth and community. If you need to ask a hundred questions before finally understanding something, then do it.

So whether you're a student fresh out of high school or a parent with three kids, you have a say in what we do around here. 

Everyone starts from somewhere, and we understand that. 

We put emphasis on  **long-term players** because we believe that they have the most impact on not only our work, but our community. You're more likely to get hired if we see you actively engaging in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kodadot) as we highly value cultural AND personal fit and contributing to KodaDot in the way that makes sense for you (are you a [developer](contrib-devs.md), [artist](contrib-artists.md), or [helper](contrib-helpers.md)?)

If everything goes well and your interests lasts, we would be more than happy to have you onboard and start our journey of exploring NFTs together.

So, get those contributions in!
