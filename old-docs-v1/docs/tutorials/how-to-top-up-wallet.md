# Adding Funds 

After [setting up](/docs/docs/tutorials/how-to-create-wallet.md) your polkadot.js wallet, you might be wondering: "How can I add funds?"

## There are several ways how you can add funds to your wallet:
### 1) The [Ramp Network](https://ramp.network)
The easiest way to add funds straight to your wallet is through KodaDot.

1) Click on your profile and choose "credit"

2) Choose the account you want to fund

![step2](/ramp_topup/ramp2.png)

3) Click on "Buy KUSAMA" which will take you to Ramp Network

![step3](/ramp_topup/ramp3.png)

4) Choose the amount and currency you'd like to add and click on "proceed"

![step4](/ramp_topup/ramp4.png)

5) Enter your email address (for confirmation purposes)

![step5](/ramp_topup/ramp5.png)

6) Enter the confirmation code sent to your email

![step6](/ramp_topup/ramp6.png)

7) You'll need to fetch your Kusama address:
    - Click on the extension icon, choose polkadot js
    - Click on the 3 dots as shown on the picture 
    - Change the network to the Kusama Relay Chain

Now your address is prefixed for Kusama Relay Chain. Send only $KSM to this address!

8) Copy your address by clicking on the "copy" icon

***Double check to make sure you're on the Kusama Relay Chain***

![step8](/ramp_topup/ramp8.png)

9) Paste it to the "Address" box and click "Confirm and Proceed"

![step9](/ramp_topup/ramp9.png)

10) Choose your payment method and click on "Proceed"

![step10](/ramp_topup/ramp10.png)

![step12](/ramp_topup/ramp12.png)

Congratulations! :tada: Once your payment goes through, you should see $KSM should in your wallet! 

### 2) Centralized Exchanges 

We've chosen to go through [Bybit](https://www.bybit.com/en-US/) in this tutorial, but the process of adding funds is similar to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en). 

Before going through this tutorial, make sure you have an account on Bybit. Create one [here](https://www.bybit.com/en-US/register)!

1) After going to [https://www.bybit.com/en-US/](https://www.bybit.com/en-US/), select "Buy crypto" and click on "Express".

![step1](/bybit_topup/bybit1.png)

2) Choose the USDT option under "I will recieve". Fill out the payment information and click "Continue". 

You are buying USDT, which is a [stablecoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin). We'll use this to buy $KSM.

![step2](/bybit_topup/bybit2.png)

3) You will be redirected to the page of your provider of choice. Fill out any information needed and proceed until you get a confirmation that you're done with the process. 

Once done, your balance in spot account will be in [USDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)).

![step3](/bybit_topup/bybit3.png)

4) To access your funds, click on "Assets" and hit "Spot account".

![step4](/bybit_topup/bybit4.png)

This process takes you to your Spot account overview, where you can check your balances.

![step5](/bybit_topup/bybit5.png)

#### Now that we've obtained USDT, we can now go on to buy $KSM! :tada:

1) Click on "Trade" and choose "USDT". Search "KSM" in the search bar.

![step6](/bybit_topup/bybit6.png)

This will take you to the exchange interface. 

2) On the right, make sure you've chosen the "Buy" and "Market" options. This will allow you to market buy $KSM. Input order value and click on Buy KSM.

![step7](/bybit_topup/bybit7.png)

3) After purchasing your $KSM, click on "Assets" and choose "Spot Account" on the top right.

![step8](/bybit_topup/bybit8.png)

This will take you to your Overview where can you withdraw your purchased coins.

4) Find KSM and click on "Withdraw"

![step9](/bybit_topup/bybit9.png)

5) A window will pop up. For security purposes, add your wallet address.

![step10](/bybit_topup/bybit10.png)

This takes you to your address list, where you can keep all your addresses for future withdrawals. 

6) Click on "Add".

![step11](/bybit_topup/bybit11.png)

**It's important to keep in mind, that your polkadot.js wallet has the network set to Kusama Relay Chain.**

7) Go to the polkadot.js extenion, click on those 3 dots at the top right and change the network to Kusama Relay Chain.

 Now your address is prefixed for the Kusama Relay Chain. Send only $KSM to this address!

![step12](/bybit_topup/bybit12.png)

8) Copy your wallet address by clicking on the copy icon.

![step13](/bybit_topup/bybit13.png)

9) Paste your wallet address in the "Address" box, come up with an Address name and click on "Continue".

![step14](/bybit_topup/bybit14.png)

10) If you have 2FA enabled (recommended), input your 2FA code and click "Continue".

![step15](/bybit_topup/bybit15.png)

11) Your address should pop up on your address list. Go to the top right and click on "Back to My Assets".

![step16](/bybit_topup/bybit16.png)

12) To withdraw $KSM, click on "Withdraw" in the KSM row.

![step17](/bybit_topup/bybit17.png)

13) You'll have a pop up. 
- Set "KSM" (Kusama) as your Coin
- Set Chain Type to KSM!
- Input your wallet address from dropdown menu 
- Enter the amount of $KSM you'd like to withdraw
- Click submit

The next window will be a confirmation of submitting your funds based on what security settings you have chosen.

#### :tada: You've successfully withdrawn your coins!

::: tip 
The process on most exchanges is similliar. The most important thing to note is to change the network to the Kusama Relay Chain in the polkadot.js wallet. [Learn](how_to_create_wallet.md) how to do it.
