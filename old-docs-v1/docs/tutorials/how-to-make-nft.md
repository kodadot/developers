 ## Create a piece of Art

 With disclaimers out of the way, let’s take a look at how you can create an NFT and bring it to market. The first step is to have or make something that can be turned into a non-fungible token. There are a lot of options here, from video game items to memes, but for the purpose of this guide we’ll assume we’re working with digital art.

 In this case, the first step is to create one. We’re not artists: This part is up to you. In the end, though, it doesn’t really matter what you want to turn into an asset, as long as it can fit into some kind of digital format. PNG seems to be the most popular for visual art—you’re set for the next step.

 ## So.. What's the flow?

 Whether you are digital artists, or you create physically, the possibility to sell your art exclusively by you without middlemen is forever here. It's possible thanks to [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) technology and couple talented wizards who are trying everyday to make life of non-technical people better. With cryptocurrencies and nfts getting more and more popular, you set foot on an interesting journey.
