- This will fork the repository so you can make changes to it

- This is important step:
    - en.json file is constantly updated with new builds and additions
    - If you want to translate for example de.json, you have to make sure you are translating according to the newest version and that is en.json.
    - Some translations might be old and not updated, it simply means you have to take what's translated and synchronize it with "en.json" and translate what's left.
    - It might be also good idea to simply start from scratch.
