- By clicking on the three dots, a window will show up enabling you to choose a different network. KodaDot is running on Kusama, so you need your Kusama address for purposes involving KodaDot. 

::: tip
Sharing your address is fine (not your seed phrase). This allows you to send/recieve funds. All your transactions are visible on blockchain, by default. 
:::

Change your network here:

Yay! You've changed to the Kusama Relay Chain. Send ONLY $KSM to this address. This is different from the "Allow to use on any chain" option.
