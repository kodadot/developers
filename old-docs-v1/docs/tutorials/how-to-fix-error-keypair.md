- There are several issues that could be causing this, however it's usually some troubles with polkadot.js

### 1. Are you using a Ledger hardware wallet? 

- Make sure your Ledger device is connected to your computer so polkadot.js can find the keys. 

### 2. Browser update

- Make sure your browser is updated and running on the latest version

### 3. Update Metadata

- Go to [polkadot.js.org](https://polkadot.js.org) It's likely that you'll see a small "1" next to Settings. If that's the case, go to Settings > Metadata and click on "Update metadata".

### 4. Disable other extensions


- If none of the above solved the issue, then there must be another extension interfering with the Polkadot extension. In order to troubleshoot this, disable them one by one and try again. 

- Start with the Polkadot- and Crypto-related extensions to pinpoint exactly which extension is causing trouble.
