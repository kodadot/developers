# What is NFT Standard ERC-6551 about?

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there is no known ERC-6551 standard in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, based on the information you provided from the web search results, it appears that ERC-6551 is a proposed standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. This proposed standard aims to allow every ERC-721 token to have its own smart contract account, enabling tokens to own assets and interact with applications without requiring changes to existing ERC-721 smart contracts or infrastructure. It includes a permissionless registry for deploying token bound accounts and a standard interface for implementing these accounts. The registry deploys each token bound account as an ERC-1167 minimal proxy, and the bytecode of the token bound accounts follows a specific structure. The token bound accounts delegate execution to a contract that implements the IERC6551Account interface. Please note that this information might be outdated, and I suggest referring to the latest resources and the Ethereum community for the most up-to-date information on ERC standards.

The purpose of ERC-6551 is to enable ERC-721 tokens to have their own smart contract accounts. This would allow tokens to own assets and interact with applications without requiring changes to existing infrastructure. The proposed standard includes a permissionless registry for deploying token bound accounts and a standard interface for implementing these accounts.

One of the key features of ERC-6551 is the ability for tokens to have their own smart contract accounts. This allows for more complex interactions between tokens and applications, as tokens can now own and manage assets on-chain. Additionally, ERC-6551 introduces a standard bytecode structure for token bound accounts, which delegates execution to a contract implementing the IERC6551Account interface.

The potential benefits of ERC-6551 are numerous. By allowing tokens to have their own accounts, it opens up new possibilities for token utility and functionality. Tokens can now own and manage assets, participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and interact with other smart contracts. This enhances the versatility and value of ERC-721 tokens, making them more powerful and dynamic.

In terms of development, implementation, and adoption, it is important to note that as of September 2021, ERC-6551 is still a proposed standard. It is not yet an official standard within the Ethereum ecosystem. Therefore, it is crucial to refer to the latest resources and engage with the Ethereum community for the most up-to-date information on ERC standards.

The development and adoption of ERC-6551 would depend on the community's interest and support. If the proposal gains traction and receives positive feedback, it may go through a formal standardization process. This typically involves discussions, feedback, and iterations within the Ethereum community to ensure the standard meets the needs of developers and users.

Overall, ERC-6551 has the potential to enhance the capabilities of ERC-721 tokens by allowing them to have their own smart contract accounts. This would enable tokens to own assets and interact with applications in a more seamless and versatile manner.
