## Reveleable and Unlockable NFTs

 NFTs are a type of non-fungible token (NFT) that have the feature of NFT reveals. This feature the owner of the NFT to show or reveal additional information or content associated with the NFT. Essentially, it enables the NFT owner to hide the end product for a specific period of time, creating suspense for users. During this time, a placeholder metadata is displayed, and then it is replaced with the final metadata when the reveal is complete. Revealable NFTs are often used to gam primary sales experiences and generate hype and engagement, as seen with Nike's successful use of NFT reveals for their RTFKT MNLTH airdrop. [1][2]
