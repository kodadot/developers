## Contribution Process

The general contribution process consists of the following steps:

2. **Assign the Issue:** To avoid duplication of effort, assign the issue to yourself. You can do this by commenting on the issue with the wave emoji. The KodaBot will then assign the issue to you.

3. **Develop a Solution:** Once the issue is assigned, start working on the solution. Be sure to adhere to the provided coding conventions & recommendations and use the recommended VSCode Extensions.

4. **Open a Pull Request:** Once you've developed a solution, open a pull request. Provide a detailed description of your changes. The community will review your pull request and provide feedback.

5. **Get Your PR Reviewed and Merged:** After a review, if your contribution is deemed valuable, your pull request will be merged.

6. **Receive a Reward:** Depending on the complexity of the issue you've solved, you can get rewarded immediately.
