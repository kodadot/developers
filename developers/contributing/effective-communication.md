# Maintaining Effective Communication as a Developer at KodaDot

Effective communication is a cornerstone of successful collaboration, especially in a globally distributed team such as KodaDot. This page offers insights on how to maintain effective communication as a developer at KodaDot, based on our culture and the experiences of our contributors.

## Communication Channels

At KodaDot, communication happens asynchronously through our public Discord and discussion channels on GitHub. Discord is used for more casual, real-time discussions, while GitHub is where we have more formal conversations about code, issues, and features. 

## Community Calls - "Meta Hours"

To keep everyone informed and foster open discussion, we conduct community calls called “Meta Hours”. Held every two weeks on our Discord server, these calls are a great platform to get updates, share ideas, and discuss ongoing projects. Everyone is encouraged to participate and contribute to these enriching discussions.

## Establish Connections and Acquire Knowledge

Being a part of KodaDot’s Discord community not only gives you access to a wealth of knowledge but also allows you to establish connections with peers. By actively participating in discussions and asking questions, you can gain valuable insights and learn from the collective wisdom of the community.

## Active Engagement and Regular Updates

Effective communication involves active engagement with the team. As Darshana Prachi, one of our developers, shares in her [Medium article](https://blog.kodadot.xyz/my-journey-as-a-developer-at-kodadot-b2b1d48afc9f), whenever you need a second opinion or feedback on your ideas, don't hesitate to reach out to team members on Discord. Regularly monitoring and responding to GitHub issues is also crucial for clarifying any doubts and staying updated on the project's progress.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

One great way to understand how other developers are resolving issues is by reviewing the pull requests they submit. This practice can offer you different perspectives and techniques, which can be very beneficial for your personal development and the projects you work on.

## Self-Learning and Technical Growth

Investing time in studying technical documentation and reading articles pertaining to web3 and blockchain is essential to comprehend the project and the subject matter thoroughly. Expanding your knowledge base will not only help you contribute more effectively but also enhance your problem-solving skills.

Through effective communication, we can foster a culture of collaboration and continuous learning, ultimately leading to the success of our individual contributors and the KodaDot project as a whole.
