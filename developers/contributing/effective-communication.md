## Communication between developers
 - communication is mostly done asynchronously either through our public Discord or discussion channels on GitHub.
 - Furthermore we try to keep our everyone up-to-date and give an open space for discussion in form of community calls called “Meta Hours” which are held every two weeks on our Discord.

Some of the quotes writen in Darshana Prachi experience as a female developer at KodaDot: [link to Medium article](https://blog.kodadot.xyz/my-journey-as-a-developer-at-kodadot-b2b1d48afc9f):

1. I became a member of Kodadot’s Discord community with the intention of establishing connections with peers and acquiring knowledge and insights.
2. My top priority was effective communication, so I made it a point to message individuals on Discord whenever I required a second opinion or feedback on my ideas. They were always willing to assist me with any queries I had. Also, I make it a point to regularly monitor Github issues and respond to comments to clarify any uncertainties I may have.
3. To understand how other developers resolved challenging and diverse issues, I reviewed the pull requests they submitted.
4. I invested numerous hours in studying technical documentation and reading articles pertaining to web3 and blockchain to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the project and the subject matter.
