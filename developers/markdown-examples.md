## Syntax Highlighting

VitePress provides Syntax Highlighting powered by [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki), with additional features like line-highlighting:

**Input**

````
```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}

- `extendFields` - extends default list with newly provided values
- `getClient` - returns GrahpQL query builder
- `getUrl` - returns GrahpQL indexer url
- `SquidClient` - returns SquidClient instance

From REST:

- `ask` - obtain data from GraphQL indexer by selected route
- `pathToRequest` - converts route to corresponding GraphQL queryss
```

export default {
  data () {
    return {
