      content: KodaDot is under continuous development, constantly striving to enhance user experience and broaden its array of features. Our present focus is on adding support for 9 NFT standards across 9 different blockchain networks, detailed as follows - Ethereum NFT Standards - ERC721, ERC1155, ERC-6551; Polkadot/Kusama NFT Standards - RMRK v1, RMRK v2, Uniques v1, NFT-pallet, gNFTs, Ink NFTs (Aleph, Astar). The following key features are currently under development and will soon be integrated into the KodaDot platform - Notifications, Webhooks, Mailing, Custodial wallets, CLI tooling, Unlockables as an SDK. We firmly believe that providing developers with console-based interaction capabilities with NFTs is critical for facilitating more complex implementations. While KodaDot has already implemented unlockables, we are working towards creating an SDK for this feature. This development will empower developers with seamless integration capabilities. These enumerated features represent a fraction of the ongoing enhancements that KodaDot undertakes daily. As an open-source ecosystem, you can stay updated with all our forthcoming features on our repository.
