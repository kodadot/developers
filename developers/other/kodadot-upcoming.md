# Future Enhancements of KodaDot

KodaDot is in continuous development, aiming to consistently enhance user experience and expand its feature set. Presently, we are focused on introducing support for 9 NFT standards across 9 different blockchain networks, detailed as follows:

### Ethereum NFT Standards:
- ERC721
- ERC1155
- ERC-6551

### Polkadot/Kusama NFT Standards:
- RMRK v1
- RMRK v2
- Uniques v1
- NFT-pallet
- gNFTs
- Ink NFTs (Aleph, Astar)

---

Currently in the pipeline, these key features are actively being developed and will soon be integrated into the KodaDot platform:

## Notifications

An integral part of KodaDot's interactive user experience, the notifications feature will keep users informed about the most recent developments. These alerts could range from new NFT listings, marketplace updates, to notifications about transactions or activities associated with a user's wallet.

## Webhooks

Webhooks are designed to enable KodaDot to transmit real-time information to external applications. This feature will be particularly beneficial for developers constructing applications on the KodaDot platform, or any third-party integrations. It will facilitate receiving instant updates, eliminating the need for continuous data polling.

## Mailing

Our upcoming mailing feature will provide KodaDot with the capacity to distribute important updates, newsletters, or personalized content straight to users' email inboxes. This feature ensures an effective communication channel with our user community and guarantees that users will not miss any vital updates, regardless of their platform activity levels.

## Custodial Wallets

_Details coming soon_

## CLI Tooling

We firmly believe that offering developers console-based interaction with NFTs is crucial for enabling more complex implementations.

These listed features form just a fraction of the continuous enhancements that KodaDot is developing daily. As an open-source ecosystem, you can stay abreast of all our future features on our repository.
