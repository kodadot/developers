# Upcoming Features in KodaDot

KodaDot is constantly evolving with the aim to deliver a better user experience and more functionalities. The following features are currently under development and will be rolled out soon:

## Notifications

Notifications will be an integral part of KodaDot, keeping users up-to-date with the latest happenings. This could range from alerts for new NFT listings, updates in the marketplace, to notifications about transactions or activities related to your wallet.

## Webhook

Webhooks provide a mechanism for KodaDot to send real-time information to other applications. This feature will be particularly useful for developers building on top of KodaDot or any third-party integrations, enabling them to receive real-time updates without having to constantly poll for new data.

## Mailing

The mailing feature will allow KodaDot to send important updates, newsletters, or personalized information directly to users' mailboxes. This not only facilitates better communication with our user base but also ensures that users won't miss out on important updates, even if they are not actively using the platform.

## Custodial Wallet SDK

The upcoming Custodial Wallet SDK is set to provide developers with a powerful set of tools to build applications that integrate with KodaDot's wallet features. This will significantly lower the barrier for entry for developers and foster a greater degree of innovation and collaboration in the KodaDot ecosystem.

These features are part of KodaDot's commitment to continuously improve the platform, ensuring a seamless, engaging, and innovative user experience. Stay tuned for these exciting updates!
