# **NFT Standards on Polkadot and Kusama**

## Introduction:
The Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems offer a diverse range of NFT standards and projects that provide exciting opportunities for developers and users alike. Kodadot, an open-source multichain NFT marketplace, has integrated with various NFT standards across multiple chains within these ecosystems, creating a dynamic environment for NFT creation, trading, and exploration.

## **KodaDot**:
We cannot begin discussing NFT standards on Polkadot and Kusama without introducing KodaDot. *KodaDot is an open-source NFT marketplace operating on the Dotsama (Kusama/Polkadot) network. It acts as an aggregator for various NFT standards in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem, enhancing the user experience by abstracting these standards.*

Now, let's explore the different NFT standards/projects on Polkadot and Kusama:

### Integrated by Kodadot:

1. **Basilisk**: Basilisk is a Kusama parachain that provides liquidity for the ecosystem. It features a full-featured NFT platform based on the Uniques pallet. Basilisk allows minting NFTs with a royalty fee, which is distributed to the original creator. It also offers a feature to create buy orders for specific NFTs.

2. **Kusama**: *Add details about NFT standards and projects specific to Kusama.*

3. **Polkadot**: *Add details about NFT standards and projects specific to Polkadot.*

4. **RMRK**: RMRK provides NFT 2.0 standards compatible with various blockchain platforms, including Polkadot and Ethereum. It offers different code flavors for NFT development, including Solidity contracts, Rust code (Substrate pallets), and ink! versions. RMRK allows builders to compose NFT systems of arbitrary complexity without smart contracts.

5. **Statemine**: Statemint is a generic assets parachain on Kusama that supports the deployment and transfer of Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

6. **Statemint**: Statemint is a generic assets parachain on Polkadot that supports the deployment and transfer of Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

### Other NFT Standards (Not yet implemented/Coming soon):

1. **Astar**: Astar Network and its sister network, Shiden Network, are smart contract infrastructures in the Polkadot ecosystem. Astar supports NFTs developed with EVM smart contracts and WASM smart contracts, providing tooling familiar to EVM NFT developers.

2. **Efinity**: Spearheaded by Enjin, Efinity is an NFT bridging chain coming to Kusama and Polkadot in 2022. It aims to provide a paratoken standard for token migration across different parachains within the Polkadot ecosystem, as well as with Ethereum and other EVM systems.

3. **Moonbeam**: Moonbeam and its Kusama counterpart, Moonriver, are full EVM deployments with Ethereum RPC endpoints. They offer compatibility with existing Ethereum tools and attract existing user bases. Many high-profile teams are launching their products on Moonbeam/Moonriver.

4. **Unique Network**: Unique Network is an NFT-specific blockchain offering innovations such as sponsored transactions, bundling fungible tokens with non-fungibles, and splitting NFTs into fungible tokens for partial ownership. It aims to be an infrastructure provider for B2B use cases and plans to make its marketplace technology open-source and white-label-friendly.

Please note that Kodadot has implemented nine NFT standards across six chains, including those mentioned above. As
