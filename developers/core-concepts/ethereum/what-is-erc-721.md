# Understanding ERC-721 Smart Contracts

ERC-721 is an Ethereum-based standard for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These tokens represent unique digital assets, like digital artwork, in-game items, or even ownership rights to real-world assets. ERC-721 tokens are different from ERC-20 tokens, which are fungible and therefore interchangeable.

The ERC-721 standard includes a set of rules that any smart contract on Ethereum must follow to produce these unique tokens. The rules include methods that the contract must implement to track the ownership of each token and to allow the tokens to be transferred or traded.

## Key Components of ERC-721

ERC-721 contracts include several key functions, including:

- `balanceOf()`: This function returns the number of NFTs owned by a specific address.
- `ownerOf()`: This function returns the owner of a specific NFT.
- `transferFrom()`: This function transfers ownership of a specific NFT from one address to another.
- `approve()`: This function allows a specific address to manage a specific NFT on behalf of its owner.

In addition, ERC-721 contracts can include optional metadata that provides additional information about each token, such as its name or a URL pointing to a description or image of the digital asset.

## Advantages of ERC-721

The main advantage of ERC-721 tokens is that they can represent ownership of unique items or assets. This makes them ideal for use cases like digital art, collectibles, and virtual real estate.

Another advantage is that each ERC-721 token is tracked individually in the contract, meaning each token can have different properties or values. This is in contrast to ERC-20 tokens, which are all identical and do not have unique attributes.
