# ERC-6551: A New NFT Token Standard

ERC-6551 is a new token standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that enhances the functionality and value of NFTs by granting them smart contract capabilities. This page will provide an overview of the ERC-6551 standard, explain its workings and potential use cases, and discuss some of its challenges and limitations.

## What is ERC-6551?

ERC-6551 functions as a smart contract wallet. This means that ERC-6551 tokens can hold other tokens and NFTs in a similar manner as a regular smart contract wallet. These so-called token-bound accounts (TBAs) are created and managed through a permissionless registry that is compatible with existing ERC-721 NFTs. The standard is co-authored by Benny Giang, a founding member of Dapper Labs, known for its work on the ERC-721 token standard and early projects like CryptoKitties.

## How Does ERC-6551 Work?

ERC-6551 resolves the limitations of standard ERC-721 NFTs which are limited in their scope and functionality. While they can be owned and transferred, they cannot hold other assets or interact with other smart contracts.

ERC-6551 introduces a permissionless registry that is compatible with existing ERC-721 NFTs. The registry, which acts as a factory and a directory for TBAs, enables anyone to create a TBA for any ERC-721 token by calling a function on the registry and paying a small fee. This results in the creation of a proxy contract that represents the TBA for the token. The proxy contract inherits all the properties and metadata of the original ERC-721 token, and also implements the EIP-1271 standard. This allows it to sign messages and verify signatures on behalf of the token, enabling interaction with other smart contracts and accounts on the Ethereum network.

## Use Cases of ERC-6551 in the NFT Space

### Composability

ERC-6551 enhances composability by allowing the bundling of an NFT with its related assets. This means all associated tokens and NFTs will be transferred along with the ERC-6551 NFT during a sale or transfer.

### Identity

With ERC-6551, each NFT can have its own identity and interact independently with DApps, regardless of the wallet holding it. This opens up possibilities for loyalty programs and in-game rewards based on an NFT's past behavior.

### Provenance

ERC-6551 allows for improved provenance, enabling a more comprehensive view of an assetâ€™s transaction history or utility beyond the proof of ownership.

### Dependency

ERC-6551 tokens can own other assets or tokens and interact with other platforms or smart contracts, enhancing their functionality and value.

## Challenges and Limitations

While ERC-6551 introduces exciting possibilities for NFTs, it also presents challenges. These include getting support from existing NFT projects and platforms, ensuring security to prevent exploits by hackers, and providing a user-friendly and intuitive experience despite the increased complexity introduced by the new standard.

## Conclusion

Despite the challenges, ERC-6551 has the potential to revolutionize the world of NFTs by giving each ERC-721 token a smart contract wallet that can own assets and interact with applications. This new level of interactivity and dynamism could open up new possibilities in gaming, art, and identity.
