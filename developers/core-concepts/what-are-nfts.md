# Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

Within the scope of Kodadot, a multichain open-source NFT marketplace, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are at the core of its operation and functionality.

## What are NFTs?

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are a type of digital asset created using blockchain technology, like Ethereum or Polkadot. Each NFT represents a unique item or piece of content and is stored on the blockchain, which certifies its authenticity and ownership.

The concept of fungibility is a crucial aspect of understanding NFTs. In economics, a fungible asset is something that can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis with another of its kind and still hold the same value. For instance, one Bitcoin is fungible with another Bitcoin, and one dollar is fungible with another dollar.

Non-fungible, then, refers to the uniqueness of the asset. No two NFTs are identical - even NFTs that exist on the same platform or in the same collection. This uniqueness can be due to the metadata or the specifics of the digital asset the NFT represents.

## Why are NFTs Important?

NFTs provide a powerful tool for digitizing and proving ownership of assets. This capability has created new possibilities in areas such as digital art, virtual real estate, collectibles, and more. By tokenizing these assets on the blockchain, creators can sell their works directly to consumers without intermediaries, and consumers can prove ownership and provenance of these digital goods.

In Kodadot's context, a multichain NFT marketplace, NFTs are the fundamental assets being bought, sold, and traded. Each NFT represents a unique piece of content—like digital art, music, or virtual property—that a user has ownership over.

## How Do NFTs Work?

NFTs work by storing information on a blockchain - a decentralized and secure ledger system. When an NFT is created, or "minted," the process involves assigning a digital asset a unique identifier and additional information, or metadata, to distinguish it from other tokens. This information is stored in a smart contract on the blockchain.

In the case of a digital art piece, for instance, the metadata might include the artist's name, the artwork's name, a description, the artwork file itself, and more. Once this information is recorded on the blockchain, it can't be altered, providing immutable proof of ownership.

Kodadot operates across 6 chains with 9 NFT standards, each with their unique ways of handling NFTs. Regardless of the chain or standard, the principle remains the same: an NFT represents a unique asset on the blockchain, providing proof of ownership and provenance.

## In Conclusion

NFTs are a groundbreaking innovation in the blockchain and digital assets world, providing a new way to own, buy, and sell unique items in a decentralized way. They form the backbone of the Kodadot marketplace, enabling the trade and exchange of unique assets across various blockchains and NFT standards.
