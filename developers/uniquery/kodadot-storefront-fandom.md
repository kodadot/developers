# Kodadot Fandom Shop

Built with [Deno](https://deno.land/) and
[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/), powered by [Uniquery](https://github.com/kodadot/uniquery) and deployed to the edge with [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

This app was built for showcasing [Uniquery](https://github.com/kodadot/uniquery), KodaDot's GraphQL API, for querying data from the blockchain. It's a simple shop that uses Uniquery to fetch NFTs from the blockchain via the [SubSquid indexer](http://subsquid.io).
