## KodaDot's Mission

As the most popular open-source NFT marketplace, KodaDot's mission goes beyond the conventional trading of digital art pieces. KodaDot is set to advance the NFT ecosystem, pioneering future use-cases like leveraging [Cross-Consensus Messaging version 3 (XCMv3)](/core-concepts/polkadot/transfering-nfts-via-chains) in [Polkadot](/core-concepts/polkadot/what-are-polkadot-and-kusama), and embracing innovative nested NFT standards such as EIP-6551 on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## The Power of Open Source

Why does being open source matter? Open-source projects foster a collaborative environment, allowing for quicker innovation and iteration cycles. Here's why open-source is critical to KodaDot:

- **Avoid redundancy:** There's no need to rebuild things that have already been built. Open-source allows developers to build on existing frameworks and libraries, accelerating development timelines.

- **Collaboration:** With over 100 contributing developers, anyone can collaborate, bringing their unique skills and perspectives to enhance the project.

- **Do more with less:** Despite a small internal team, open-source allows KodaDot to harness the potential of a global developer community, paving the way for rapid innovation.

- **Quicker iteration cycles:** Open-source projects can evolve rapidly. Feedback and contributions from the community lead to quicker iteration cycles and a more robust final product.

For anyone aspiring to build an NFT-based product, KodaDot offers an extensive resource of tools and implementations that have been tried and tested in real-world applications. Join the KodaDot community and be part of this exciting journey into the future of NFTs.
